## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)  
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for Solidity development  
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)  

### Setup  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/GillHapp/rollup_espresso-  
   cd rollup_espresso-  
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies and build the project**  
   ```bash  
   yarn install  
   yarn build  
   yarn build:forge  
   ```

## Deploying Contracts to Sepolia  

### Step 1: Compile Contracts  
Run the following commands to compile the contracts locally:  
```bash  
yarn build  
yarn build:forge  
```  

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables  
1. Copy the sample environment file:  
   ```bash  
   cp .env.sample.goerli .env  
   ```  
2. Open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:  
   - **Etherscan API Key:** [Obtain it here](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics).  
   - **Infura API Key:** [Create API here](https://docs.infura.io/dashboard/create-api).  
   - **Private Key:** Add a private key with some funds on the Sepolia network.  
   
   This key will be used to deploy the rollup contracts.  

3. **ROLLUP_CREATOR_ADDRESS:**  
   - If you want to use an already deployed `RollupCreator`, update this address in the `espresso-deployments/sepolia.json` file.  
   - Otherwise, leave it empty and follow Step 3 to deploy your own.  

### Step 3: Deploy Rollup Creator and Initialize Espresso Contracts  
To deploy the rollup creator and initialize Espresso contracts, run:  
```bash  
npx hardhat run scripts/deployment.ts --network sepolia  
```  

### Step 4: Create the Rollup  
1. Rename `config.ts.example` to `config.ts`:  
   ```bash  
   mv config.ts.example config.ts  
   ```  
2. Update the rollup-specific configurations in the `config.ts` file.  
3. Run the following command to create the rollup:  
   ```bash  
   npx hardhat run scripts/createEthRollup.ts --network sepolia  
   ```

## Deployed Contract Addresses  
Once the deployment is successful, the following contracts will be created and verified on Sepolia:

## License  

Nitro is currently licensed under a [Business Source License](./LICENSE.md), similar to Uniswap and Aave, with an **Additional Use Grant**.  

This grant ensures users can run nodes on public Arbitrum chains without restrictions and deploy the Nitro software in a permissionless, cost-free manner if the chain settles to Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.  

### Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP)  
For deployments on Ethereum (L2) or other Layer-2 solutions, the [Arbitrum Expansion Program (AEP)](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/Arbitrum%20Expansion%20Program%20Jan182024-4f08b0c2cb476a55dc153380fa3e64b0.pdf) permits permissionless deployment, with a requirement to contribute **10% of net revenue** back to the Arbitrum community.
